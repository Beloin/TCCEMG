# How to Read EMG Signal

## Sensor and Raw Data

Sensor Name: Three‚Äêlead Differential Muscle/Electromyography Sensor for Microcontroller Applications (Minified as "TLDEMG")


### Low Filter:

Studied used Butterworth filter[[2]][[3]], but don't know yet what type of low pass filter is used in TLDEMG.


EMG Signals vary between 20Hz - 500Hz.
